FILES:

-> download_prob.py: Used to receive responses from Competitive Companion and
calls 'make_prob.sh' using these data.

-> make_prob.sh: Shell script that creates a folder using the name
provided and populates it with the content of your
'~/programming/.template/' directory.

-> .template/: Contains files which will be used in all your
subdirectories e.g: Makefiles, template files, e.t.c.

USAGE:

1) Firstly, create your folder where all the problem dirs will be stored.
If it's for CodeForces, just navigate into the the 'CF' folder and carry out the next step.

2) Run '~/programming/download_prob.py'. This will listen for Competitive Companion's response from the browser. Head over to your browser and click the Competitive Companion button to send the data. Note you can specify the number of questions to receive using the '-n' option. You can also rename the qproblem names on the spot using: '~/programming/download_prob.py one two three'

3) For each problem, a corresponding folder will be created containing a copy of all the files in your '~/programming/.template/' folder and alsothe input and output files fetched from Competitive Companion.

4) You can run your code using the Makefile in each problem directory:
NOTE: These commands will automatically create a '.precomputed_headers/' directory if no one is found in the current folder.

- make test -> Compiles your code and runs the executable file with all the *.in files. Then it runs the 'diff' command for each *.res && *.out files and prints out the differences if any.
- make run -> Compiles your code and runs the executable file prompting you for input if needed
- make runs -> Compiles your code and executes the executable file passing every *.in file to it one by one. It creates a corresponding *.res file containing the output of your code.
- make solve -> Same as 'make runs'.
- make all -> Compiles your code but doesn't run the executable file.
- make clean -> Deletes the executable file and the '.precomputed_headers/' directory.
- make veryclean -> Deletes the executable file, the '.precomputed_headers/' directory and the *.res files
- make rebuild -> calls 'make clean' and 'make all'.
